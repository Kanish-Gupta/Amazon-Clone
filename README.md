## Amazon-Clone
Welcome to the Amazon Clone repository! This project is a demonstration of my skills in web development, showcasing a replica of the popular e-commerce platform Amazon. Through this project, I aimed to recreate the  design aspects of Amazon's user interface.

**Note:** This clone does not include any functional features, such as searching, dynamic content, or interactivity. It only focuses on replicating the visual appearance of the Amazon website's front page.
